 # Unified National Electoral Roll (UNPER) System

A centralized, secure, and legally compliant platform for managing a Unified National Electoral Roll, inspired by the Election Commission of India’s UNPER initiative.
The system integrates database-driven voter management, AI/ML-based duplicate detection, and blockchain-backed auditability.

## 📌 Problem Statement

India’s electoral rolls are traditionally maintained at the state level, leading to:

Duplication during inter-state migration

Delays in voter roll updates

Limited transparency and auditability

Risk of inconsistencies across jurisdictions

This project proposes a single national source of truth for electoral data while preserving legally mandated workflows such as Form-6 migration approvals.

## 🎯 Objectives

Maintain one national identity per elector

Support legal voter migration without duplicate voting

Enable role-based electoral administration

Preserve audit trails and data integrity

Support multilingual electoral rolls

Provide clean integration points for AI/ML and Blockchain
